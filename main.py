# to add
# Todo add in the device name and polymer etc into the graphs when they get saved
# Todo Statistics- pull data from the statisitcs sheet i fill out when measuring the devices
#  - creat a file that saves all the data collected from each device an sweeps within the data
# - histogram all the data
# - reorganise the functions
#
# Add a try except when file reading, so if the first way dosnt work it tries something else.
# i.e tries csv or a different method of extracting data from a text file
# add something about working out what kind of data i am taking and it should react acodingly
# have it create the origin graphs for all files towards the end, hiwever only do this if there isnt already an origin
# file created for each

# creats a sub folder that containes all information used within python called "python info" here oit saves all the
# dataframes, the arry info and anything else ready for use later, create another folder named images where it saves
# all the images for each file and within that have another for each of the looped data with all the individual
# images in, with a full overview of each create a final overview pdf of each device with all the sweeps information
# ie average enclosed area, avaerage switching
#

# find a way to incorporate the file created that keeps track of all the info from each sweep from past resuts where
# i give the endurance nuber of sweeps etc celled _____
