Seaborn:

Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics. It simplifies many aspects of creating visualizations, and its integration with Matplotlib makes it easy to combine plots.
Plotly:

Plotly is a graphing library that makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online. It supports various types of plots, including scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and more. Plotly's make_subplots function allows you to combine multiple plots into a single figure easily.
Bokeh:

Bokeh is another interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Bokeh can produce elegant and interactive graphics, and its gridplot function helps in combining multiple plots.
Altair:

Altair is a declarative statistical visualization library based on Vega and Vega-Lite visualization grammars. It is particularly well-suited for creating complex visualizations easily and supports combining multiple plots.
ggplot (plotnine in Python):

Inspired by ggplot2 in R, plotnine is a Python implementation of a grammar of graphics. It is powerful and flexible, allowing for complex plots to be created by combining simple components.
SubplotMosaic (part of Matplotlib):

Although part of Matplotlib, the subplot_mosaic function is a powerful tool to create complex layouts. It allows you to arrange your plots in a grid and specify the arrangement using a more readable syntax.
Here's a brief example of using Plotly to combine plots:
